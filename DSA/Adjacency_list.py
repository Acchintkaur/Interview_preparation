# Which is better â€“ adjacency matrix or adjacency list?
# Adjacency list has the upper hand over the adjacency matrix because of its efficiency. 
# An adjacency list occupies less memory space than an adjacency matrix. 
# In addition, it is easier to iterate over the edges in the adjacency list because 
# the neighboring nodes for a given node can be accessed easily. 
# Also, creating edges and nodes in a list is efficient compared to creating edges and nodes in a matrix.
